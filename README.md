# 🌆 How Kolkata Breathed in 2023: A Self-Driven Pollution Dashboard

This project is inspired by a research internship listing on the ISRO Careers Portal that proposed the use of AI/ML for satellite-based air pollution monitoring.  
While I do not yet work with AI, I recreated the concept using tools I know: **Excel** and **Power BI**.

## 📌 Data Source: Simulated real-world structure inspired by OpenAQ, based on 5+ monitoring zones in South Kolkata  

## 📊 What This Project Shows

- PM2.5 and PM10 monthly trends across Kolkata
- Traffic and industrial pollutants: NO₂, SO₂
- Carbon emissions and ozone formation patterns
- PM2.5 health risk zones
- Multi-station pollutant heatmaps
- Station-wise pollutant averages (2023)
- Peak pollutant levels across city zones

## 📂 Files Included

- `kolkata_pollution_2023_simulated.xlsx` – Simulated dataset structured like OpenAQ (all major Kolkata stations)
- `satellite_pollution_mapping.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file

---

## 🧠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Microsoft Power BI  

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **PM2.5** and **NO₂** levels show strong monthly variation across industrial and residential zones
- Certain stations like **Fort William** and **Bidhannagar** maintain consistently higher NO₂ levels
- O₃ formation patterns were mapped in relation to carbon emissions, revealing non-linear behavior
